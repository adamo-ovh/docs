## Objective

This page provides the technical capabilities and limitations of the Cloud Databases (Beta) MongoDB offer.

## Capabilities and limitations

### Supported regions

The Cloud Databases (Beta) offer is available in the following regions:

- `BHS` (Beauharnois, Canada)
- `GRA` (Gravelines, France)

### MongoDB version

The Cloud Databases (Beta) offer supports the following MongoDB versions:

- MongoDB 4.2
- MongoDB 4.4

MongoDB recommends always installing and using the latest stable version of MongoDB. See [MongoDB Versioning](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/versioning/){.external} for more information.

### Drivers

You can use any one of the [MongoDB-recommended driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/){.external} to access your cluster.

### Plans

Three plans are available:

- *Essential*
- *Business*
- *Enterprise* (coming soon - stay tuned!)

Here is an overview of the various plans capabilities:

| Plan         | Number of nodes | MongoDB License | BI Connector  | Compass       |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ------------  | -------       |
| *Essential*  | 1               | Community       | Not Available | Not Available |
| *Business*   | 3 to 8          | Community       | Not Available | Not Available |
| *Enterprise* | 3 to 8          | Enterprise      | Available     | Available     |

Your choice of plan affects the number of nodes your cluster can run as well as the MongoDB license type.

#### Nodes

- *Essential*: The cluster supports at most one node.
- *Business* or *Enterprise*: The cluster can support 3 to 8 nodes.

##### License type

- *Essential* and *Business* plans use the MongoDB Community license.
- *Enterprise* plans upgrade your cluster so that it uses the MongoDB Enterprise license, giving you the capability to use the [MongoDB BI Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/products/bi-connector){.external} as well as [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass){.external}.

### Hardware resources

Here are the node types you can choose from:

| Name    | Disk (GB) | Cores | Memory (GB) |
| ------- | --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| db1-7   | 50        | 2     | 7           |
| db1-15  | 100       | 4     | 15          |
| db1-30  | 200       | 8     | 30          |
| db1-60  | 400       | 16    | 60          |
| db1-120 | 400       | 32    | 120         |

Right now, all nodes of a given cluster should be of the same type and live in the same regions.

#### Effective storage

The disk size listed above is the total disk size of the underlying machine, however, a small part of it goes towards the OS install.

We try hard to avoid "disk full" situations that could be harmful to cluster health. Therefore, the cluster will become read-only before actually reaching full physical disk capacity. You should aim for no more than 80% disk space usage.

### Networking

MongoDB clusters are reachable through port 27017.

Public networking can be used for all the offers.

Private Networking (vRack) is available for *Business* and *Enterprise*.

### Backups

*Essential* plan clusters are automatically backed up daily during their maintainance window. Backup retention is 2 days.

*Business* plan clusters are automatically backed up daily during their maintainance window. Backup retention is 7 days.

*Enterprise* plan clusters are automatically backed up daily during their maintainance window, with [PITR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-in-time_recovery){.external} support. Backup retention is 7 days.

### Users

In order to properly manage your MongoDB cluster, some MongoDB users are set up in your clusters:

- `admin@admin` is your initial user
- `mms-automation@admin` is a technical user required for automation purposes
- `backup-*@admin` are used to perform backups

Furthermore, user creation from the MongoDB Shell is unsupported: You need to use the OVHcloud API or the OVHcloud Control Panel in order to manage your clusters' users.
